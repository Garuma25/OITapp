This is my "Convert RomanNum to Decimal"

I declared a variable result to store the decimal equivalent of the Roman numeral, and a string s to store the input Roman numeral.

The user is prompted to enter a Roman numeral using the cout statement and the input is stored in the s variable using the cin statement.

The for loop is used to iterate through each character in the s string. The loop uses a switch statement to determine the decimal equivalent of each character and adds it to the result variable. The if and else if statements inside the switch statement handle the cases where a smaller numeral is subtracted from a larger numeral, such as in the case of "IV" (4) or "IX" (9).

The decimal equivalent of the Roman numeral is output using the cout statement.

The program terminates with a return value of 0.

I am still having trouble meeting the requirements for step 4, but the program still outputs an error message when the Roman numeral is invalid

Time complexity is O(n)
It took me around 2:44 hours
